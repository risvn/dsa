=================================**graphs**=================================

g=(v,e)
graph are of two types directed and undirected

self-loop: if both edge points are same
mult-edge: if it occurs more than once
ex:cities with flight roots

simple-graphs: no multi-edge,no self-loop
max no edges in dir graph 0<=|E|<=n(n-1)
max no edges in undir graph 0<=|E|<=n(n-1)\2

dense-> to many edges
parse-> to few edges

path/walk: a seq of vertices where each adj pair is connected by an edge
path(simple-path) : a walk in which no vertices (and thus no edges) are repeated
trail: a walk in which no edges are repeated
